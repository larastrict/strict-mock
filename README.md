## Main mission

- Takes the good stuff from Domain Driven Development
- Make the code more testable via Unit tests (for faster tests)
- Make database queries reusable and testable -> `Queries`
- Make caching more reusable and testable -> `CacheMeService`
- Move business logic to `Actions` or `Services`
- Setup Laravel for great docker experience.
